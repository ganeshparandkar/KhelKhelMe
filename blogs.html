                                    <hr style="opacity: 0.5;">
                                </div>
                                <p style="color: black;">If you think, Jigsaw Puzzles are only for kids, then you must read this. I have never been a Jigsaw person as a child, my addiction is only recent. In this article, I am going to share not only my journey, but also the various benefits one can earn by solving Jigsaw Puzzles.</p>
            
                                <p style="color: black;">Just a few months back, I bought some Jigsaw puzzles of 250, 500 and 1000 pieces for our annual game programmes. To get a sense of timing, I decided to first solve one before I give it to the kids. The very first one of 250 pieces got me hooked on to it, and the Jigsaw fever started growing on me. Before I could know, I was already an addict. Another design of 250 pieces, then another and another… </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Solving the first one of 250 pieces was quite challenging; so before moving on to 500, I solved a few more of 250 and even repeated them. Then one Saturday, after the Jigsaw class with the kids, I dared to begin with the 500 pieces set. It was crazy! One of my friend joined me too, and we both were hooked on to it till 2.00 am, yet it wasn’t complete till the following day. </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Next weekend, I again picked up the same 500 pieces set, and timed myself. It took me almost 7 hours to solve it all by myself. Every weekend, I would look forward to solving one set. The next 500 pieces set that I picked up was a tough one and it rolled over to a few days to solve it (putting in some time daily) along with an 8-day tour in between. </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Announcement of the Covid lockdown initiated me to start with my 1000 pieces set. This was a tough one dominated by just 2-3 colours. Searching for just the border pieces and completing it took me over an hour. It took me 6 days to complete the whole thing even after pouring in 3-4 hours daily, at times more, finally resulting in a great sense of achievement. </p>

                                <hr style="opacity: 0.5;">
                            </div>
                            <p style="color: white;">Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical model used to classify the Educational Learning Objectives. It is
                                an important theory considered while planning the curriculum. It covers three domains – Cognitive,
                                Affective and Psychomotor Domains. Each of these domains have their hierarchies that defines the
                                stages one passes through while learning something.</p>
          
                            <p style="color: white;">In this article, I am going to talk about the Cognitive Domain and how games play a role in each of the
                                levels of Cognitive Domain, and how is Game Therapy used to empower one’s learning.</p>
                            
                            <p style="color: white;">The Cognitive domain has six hierarchical levels. Let us understand each level, and what kind of games can be useful to stimulate them. The first level
                                is to ‘Remember’, which is given the highest importance in our current education system. Most of the
                                examinations require this level to be achieved. Thus, for academic success, the first step it to have a
                                good working memory.</p>
                            
                            <p style="color: white;">Most of us have a good long-term memory, but working memory is different than long term memory.
                                There is a big range of games that can enhance our working memory. However, I would talk about my
                                top 5 favourite games that I feel are really effective in improving the memory skills.</p>
                            
                            <p style="color: white;"><b> Brain Cache, a Card Game: </b>(For all ages (above 7), including senior citizens)
                                Launched towards the end of November 2019, designed by a creative bunch of people
                                including a Neuro-Scientist, this game includes many scientific elements to make it effective
                                to aid the memory function of the brain.
                                Brain Cache is a fun card game that can be played Solo or 2 to 11 players. It has memory cards
                                to be memorised fast and effectively, followed by Question Cards that test the memory. You
                                need finish all your cards first to win the game.</p>

                            <p style="color: white;"><b>Face Tag, a Board Game:</b> (For all ages above 8 years)
                                Face Tag is a 2 to 4 players board game play that involves one to remember faces, their names
                                and cities that you assign to them for that board. The better your memory and recall, the
                                faster you can pass thru’ the board and win the Game. It’s again a new launch in 2020,
                                designed by an innovative person, and a game of my Like.</p>
                            
                            <p style="color: white;"><b>Jigsaw Puzzles:</b>
                                Though many people do not realise, or directly relate a jigsaw puzzle to memory, I can assure
                                that the working memory is highly exercised in solving bigger Jigsaw puzzles. Being an absolute
                                lover of Jigsaw puzzles and having solved multiple 500 and 1000 pieces puzzles, I have
                                experienced the need to use visual memory, visual observation and recall skills, and highly
                                recommend playing of Jigsaw puzzles to children as well as children.</p>

                            (Game for Kids above 4 years)
                            This is a speedy memory game for younger children. This game requires children to pay
                            attention to the character shoes, remember the pattern and find it in same design, or in the
                            dark (shadow objects). It is a fun way with a story board to involve the kids, and stimulate
                            their working memory.</p>
                        
                        <p style="color: white;"><b>Seas The Day Card Game: </b>

                            of matching and learning for kids, and enhances the visual memory and observation. Game
                            variations allow the older ones to get engaged.</p>

Before I could know, I was already an addict. Another design of 250 pieces, then another and another… </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Solving the first one of 250 pieces was quite challenging; so before moving on to 500, I solved a few more of 250 and even repeated them. Then one Saturday, after the Jigsaw class with the kids, I dared to begin with the 500 pieces set. It was crazy! One of my friend joined me too, and we both were hooked on to it till 2.00 am, yet it wasn’t complete till the following day. </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Next weekend, I again picked up the same 500 pieces set, and timed myself. It took me almost 7 hours to solve it all by myself. Every weekend, I would look forward to solving one set. The next 500 pieces set that I picked up was a tough one and it rolled over to a few days to solve it (putting in some time daily) along with an 8-day tour in between. </p>
                                
                                <p style="color: black;">Announcement of the Covid lockdown initiated me to start with my 1000 pieces set. This was a tough one dominated by just 2-3 colours. Searching for just the border pieces and completing it took me over an hour. It took me 6 days to complete the whole thing even after pouring in 3-4 hours daily, at times more, finally resulting in a great sense of achievement. </p>
